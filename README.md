# openbsd-changelog

openbsd-changelog is a small utility to show changelog entries from OpenBSD-current.

## USAGE

1. Install needed dependencies
```
# pkg_add py3-beautifulsoup4
```
2. Run the script
```
$ ./openbsd-changelog
```

**NOTE:**  
The output of the script is colored, keep that in my mind when piping the output to a different program.
